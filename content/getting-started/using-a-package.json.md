# Working with package.json

The best way to manage locally installed npm packages is to create a
`package.json` file. 

A `package.json` file: 

* lists the packages that your project depends on.
* allows you to specify the versions of a package that your project
can use using [semantic versioning rules][1].
* makes your build reproducible, and therefore *much* easier
to share with other developers.

## Requirements

A `package.json` must have:

- `"name"`
  - all lowercase
  - one word, no spaces
  - hyphens and underscores allowed
- `"version"`
  - in the form of `x.x.x`
  - follows [semver spec](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning)

For example:

```
{
  "name": "my-awesome-package",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Creating a `package.json`

There are two basic ways to create a package.json file. 

### 1. Run a CLI questionnaire 

To create a `package.json` with values that you supply, run:

```
> npm init
```

This will initiate a command line questionnaire that will conclude with the 
creation of a `package.json` in the directory in which you initiated the command.

### 2. Create a default `package.json`

To get a default `package.json`, run `npm init` with the `--yes`
or `-y` flag:

```
> npm init --yes
```

This method will generate a default `package.json` using information extracted from the current directory.

```
> npm init --yes
Wrote to /home/ag_dubs/my_package/package.json:

{
  "name": "my_package",
  "description": "",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/my_package.git"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/my_package/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/my_package"
}
```

- `name`: the current directory name
- `version`: always `1.0.0`
- `description`: info from the readme, or an empty string `""`
- `main`: always `index.js`
- `scripts`: by default creates an empty `test` script
- `keywords`: empty
- `author`: empty
- `license`: [`ISC`][2]
- `bugs`: info from the current directory, if present
- `homepage`: info from the current directory, if present

You can also set several config options for the init command. Some useful ones:


```
> npm set init.author.email "wombat@npmjs.com"
> npm set init.author.name "ag_dubs"
> npm set init.license "MIT"
```

#### NOTE:

If there is no description field in the `package.json`, npm uses the first line of the `README.md` or README instead. The description helps people find your package when searching npm, so it's definitely useful to make a custom description in the `package.json` to make your package easier to find.

### How to Customize the `package.json` questionnaire 

If you expect to create many package.json files, you might wish to customize the questions asked during the init process, so that the files always contain key information that you expect. You can customize the fields as well as the questions that are asked. 

To do this, you create a custom `.npm-init.js` in your home directory
`~/.npm-init.js`.

A simple `.npm-init.js` might look something like this:

```
module.exports = {
  customField: 'Custom Field',
  otherCustomField: 'This field is really cool'
}
```

Running `npm init` with this file in your home directory would output a `package.json` that included these lines:
```
{
  customField: 'Custom Field',
  otherCustomField: 'This field is really cool'
}
```

You can also customize the questions by using the `prompt` function.

```
  module.exports = prompt("what's your favorite flavor of ice cream, buddy?", "I LIKE THEM ALL");
```

## Specifying Dependencies

To specify the packages your project depends on, you need to 
list the packages you'd like to use in your `package.json` file. There are
2 types of packages you can list:

- `"dependencies"`: These packages are required by your application in production.
- `"devDependencies"`: These packages are only needed for development and testing.

### Manually editing your `package.json`

You can manually edit your `package.json`. You'll need to create an attribute
in the package object called `dependencies` that points to an object. This object will hold attributes that name the packages you'd like to use. It will point to a [semver][1] expression that specifies the versions of that project that are compatible with your project.

If you have dependencies you only need to use during local development,
follow the same instructions as above but use the attribute called `devDependencies`.

For example, the project below uses any version of the package `my_dep` that matches major version 1 in production and requires any version of the package `my_test_framework` that matches major version 3, but only for development:

```
{
  "name": "my_package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "my_dep": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies" : {
    "my_test_framework": "^3.1.0"
  }
}
```

### The `--save` and `--save-dev` install flags

The easier (and more awesome) way to add dependencies to your `package.json` is to do
so from the command line, flagging the `npm install` command with either `--save` or
`--save-dev`, depending on how you'd like to use that dependency.

To add an entry to your `package.json`'s `dependencies`:

```
npm install <package_name> --save
```

To add an entry to your `package.json`'s `devDependencies`:

```
npm install <package_name> --save-dev
```

## Managing dependency versions 

npm uses Semantic Versioning, or, as we often refer to it, SemVer, to manage versions and ranges of versions of packages.

If you have a `package.json` file in your directory and you run `npm install`, npm will look at the dependencies that are listed in that file and download the latest versions, using semantic versioning.
