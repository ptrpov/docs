# If your npm is broken

[Reinstall npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

If you're on Windows and you have a broken installation, the easiest thing to do is to reinstall node from the official installer (see [this note about installing the latest stable version](https://docs.npmjs.com/troubleshooting/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm#upgrading-on-windows)).
