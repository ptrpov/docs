# How to Contribute to npm docs

Participation in this open source project is subject to the
[npm Code of Conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct).

Please also ensure your contribution conforms to the [Contributing Guidelines].

## Contributing

1. Find an issue you would like to solve. If you are solving a problem
   that does not have an issue filed yet, file one.
2. Fork and clone the project. Solve the problem!
3. (if relevant) Document any changes you made in the correct place.
4. (if relevant) Write a test to show your solution solves the problem.
5. Open a PR. Somewhere in the body it should say `Fixes #<issue>`, 
    where `#<issue>` is the issue number of the issue you are closing.

## Commit Messages

The commit history of a project should read like that project's recipe.
Commit messages should be written in the active present tense, e.g.,:

`fix typo in how-npm-works dedupe section`

Other items:
- You will be asked to [squash your commits].
- Rebase is preferred over merge.

Note: Everything in git can be fixed, so don't be intimidated by these
requirements! We're here to help you through it, if you need it :).

- [`your-first-pr`][1]: reserved for people with little to no
  GitHub contributions- we're here to help you start your OS journey!
- [`patches welcome`][2]: these issues are specifically well suited
  for outside contributors.
